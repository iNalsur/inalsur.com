# TJH Puunkaato ja metsänhoitopalvelut | Company Website

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is my first big project that I did for my friend entrepreneur. During my studying in Codecademy, I needed to make a project called “Company Home Page” using the Flexbox method to understand how the site changes when the screen is resized.

During the task, I could use a fictitious company, but I preferred to do a project for an existing company, as this would help me gain experience with working with a client as well.

<h2>Tools</h2>
While working, I used the MacOs system, wrote code in the Visual Studio Code program. The programming languages HTML and CSS were used in this project. For processing photos and pictures I used Photshop and WebP Converter. For the first release, I used GitHub, unfortunately at that moment I was not familiar with the work of Git, because of this I did not use commits. Using Google Chrome Dev Tools, I tested the site's performance.

<h2>Process</h2>

After I discussed the details with a friend/client, I got to work.

I first drew the wireframes and after that discussed it again with a friend/client, after we were satisfied I got to work writing the site.

The site is made simply, it consists of one page, the page has a sections of navigation, content and footer. The site consists of 3 sectors, introduction with the company, introduction with the work and contact information. Also in different sectors there are buttons that redirect the user to special sectors on the website, there are also buttons that redirect to other sites (social media), a button through which you can immediately call the entrepreneur, and also a button through which you can immediately send an email message to the entrepreneur. The site has a different look, when the screen is resized, for example, on a tablet, the words in the navigation disappear and icons appear instead, the long name of the company becomes short. In the sector with introduction with the company, the photo on the left side goes to the center, and the text on the right side lies on the photo, and for the phone version, a lot of things change as well. For this, was used the code in CSS [@media only screen and…].

A lot of different things have also been added to the head, for example, when sharing a site on a smartphone, the link will have important fact-finding information like a photo, a mini-text about the company. Also, the site has a theme color and an icon for home screen on the iOS platform, etc.

At the end, the site was shown to a friend / client, after which we found a hosting hotel together, a friend bought a domain address and I helped him set up the site to work on his own domain (this was my first experience).

<h2>Outcome</h2>

A friend/client and I were satisfied with the result, I got a lot of experience and continued studying.
